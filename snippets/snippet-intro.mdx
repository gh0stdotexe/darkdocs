Control D is a customizable DNS filtering and traffic redirection platform. It can do all the things your standard DNS resolver can (resolve domains to IP addresses), but it can also do a lot more. Think of it as your personal Authoritative DNS resolver for the entire Internet that gives you granular control over what domains get resolved, redirected or blocked.

<Tip>
Control D is a DNS service that you can customize to your needs.

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). This is a principle that apply to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.
