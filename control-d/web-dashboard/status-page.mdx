# Status Page

The Control D status page provides real-time information about our service availability and performance metrics.

## Service Status

Our status page shows the current state of:
- DNS resolvers
- Web dashboard
- API endpoints
- Network infrastructure

## Performance Metrics

We monitor and display:
- DNS response times
- Server load
- Network latency
- Infrastructure health

<Warning>
**Personal Information**

The status page does not display any personal or account-specific information. It only shows aggregate system metrics.
</Warning>

## DNS Performance

We track DNS performance across different:
- Geographic regions
- Network providers
- Protocol types (DoH, DoT, DoQ)

<Note>
**Higher Latency than DNS**

Some protocols like DNS-over-HTTPS may have slightly higher latency compared to traditional DNS due to the additional encryption overhead.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Different IP from DNS Source IP**

If you're using a proxy or VPN, your source IP for DNS queries may differ from your actual IP address. This is normal and expected behavior.
