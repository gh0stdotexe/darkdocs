# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
ACTION: Perform a full repository scan, validation, and refactoring operation exclusively on `.mdx` files.

TARGET FILES: All files ending with `.mdx` in the entire current repository.

TASKS TO PERFORM AUTOMATICALLY ON EACH `.mdx` FILE:

1.  **Core MDX/JSX Syntax Validation & Correction:**
    *   Ensure all JSX elements are correctly closed (`<Tag>...</Tag>`) or self-closed (`<Tag />`). Fix any mismatches or unclosed tags.
    *   Ensure JSX elements are nested correctly according to standard rules. Fix invalid nesting.
    *   Validate JSX attribute syntax (using quotes for strings `prop="value"`, curly braces for expressions `prop={variable}`). Correct malformed attributes.

2.  **HTML to Markdown/Mintlify Component Replacement:**
    *   Replace `<img>` tags with Mintlify `<Image src='...' alt='...' />` components, transferring `src` and `alt`.
    *   Replace simple `<a>` hyperlink tags with Markdown links `[text](mdc:url)`, preserving `href` and text.
    *   Replace HTML lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) with equivalent Markdown list syntax.
    *   Replace HTML tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`) with equivalent Markdown table syntax.
    *   Replace `<p>` tags with standard Markdown paragraphs (ensure content separation with blank lines).
    *   Replace `<pre><code>...</code></pre>` blocks with Markdown fenced code blocks (```), attempting to add the language identifier if found in HTML classes (e.g., ```javascript).
    *   Replace inline `<code>...</code>` tags with Markdown backticks `` `code` ``.
    *   Replace `<b>`/`<strong>` tags with Markdown `**bold**`.
    *   Replace `<i>`/`<em>` tags with Markdown `*italic*` or `_italic_`.

EXECUTION MODE: **Strictly Non-Interactive Batch Processing**

*   **CRITICAL:** You MUST process ALL `.mdx` files in the repository in one continuous operation without stopping or pausing.
*   **DO NOT** stop after processing a few files.
*   **DO NOT** ask me if you should continue or fix more files at any point.
*   **COMPLETE** the entire set of tasks for all files automatically.

ERROR HANDLING:
*   If you encounter an unrecoverable error while processing a specific file that prevents you from applying fixes or replacements:
    *   Output the error log line: `❌ [filename] - error processing`
    *   Skip that specific file entirely.
    *   Immediately continue processing the next `.mdx` file without halting the overall operation.

OUTPUT LOGGING:
*   For **only** the files that you successfully modify (apply syntax fixes or HTML replacements): Output a single line exactly matching: `✅ [filename] - fixed`
*   Do not output any messages for files that are scanned but require no changes.
*   Do not output any other conversational text, summaries, or confirmations.

Proceed now with the automated validation and refactoring of all `.mdx` files according to these instructions.
