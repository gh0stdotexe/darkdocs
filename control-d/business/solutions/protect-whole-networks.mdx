Problem: Widespread Network Vulnerabilities

Modern networks extend beyond the office walls, intertwining with cloud-based services and remote work environments, and along with this expansion comes an increased attack surface for cyber threats. Entire networks can fall prey to malware which can disrupt business operations, cryptojacking that hijacks resources for cryptocurrency mining, and phishing campaigns that target company and customer data. Traditional antivirus software and firewalls aren't always enough, as they often act too late in the threat timeline. Moreover, complex network structures make implementing a security solution that covers all entry points a challenge, especially for those without extensive IT resources.
