# Dynamic DNS

## What is Dynamic DNS?

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that allows you to map a domain name to an IP address that changes frequently. This is particularly useful for home networks where your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP address that can change at any time.

Control D can monitor your DDNS hostname and automatically update your authorized IPs when changes are detected.

## How to Use DDNS

<Steps>
1. Go to your Device settings in the Control D dashboard
2. Enable Legacy DNS resolver
3. Add your DDNS hostname in the "Dynamic DNS" section
4. Control D will automatically monitor and update your authorized IPs
</Steps>
