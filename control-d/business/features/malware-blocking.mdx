## Overview

Control D provides multi-layered malware protection, combining traditional blocklists with advanced AI-powered detection.

### Protection Layers
- Domain-level threat intelligence
- IP-level threat detection
- Machine learning classification
- Real-time analysis

## AI Malware Filter

Our experimental AI-powered filter uses machine learning to identify malicious domains before they appear in any blocklists.

### Detection Modes

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Relaxed" icon="shield-check">
    Only blocks high-confidence malicious domains. Recommended for most users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balanced" icon="shield-halved">
    Blocks medium-confidence threats. May have occasional false positives.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strict" icon="shield-xmark">
    Blocks low-confidence threats. High false positive rate, use with caution.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration

```yaml
malware_protection:
  enabled: true
  mode: "relaxed"  # relaxed, balanced, or strict
  ai_filter: true
  threat_feeds: true
  ip_protection: true
```

## Handling False Positives

If you encounter a false positive:

1. For popular domains:
   - Report to support@controld.com
   - Include domain and timestamp

2. For lesser-known domains:
   - Create a bypass rule in your profile
   - Use the quick-edit button in Activity Log

<Warning>
The AI Malware Filter is experimental and may cause false positives for less popular websites or uncommon TLDs.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Start with the Relaxed mode and adjust based on your security needs and tolerance for false positives.
