Problem: The Challenge of Monitoring and Understanding Network Activity

For businesses to effectively manage their networks and maintain security, visibility into network traffic is key. Unfortunately, the vast amount of data exchange that occurs on a network is often a black box, with IT teams being reactive rather than proactive when issues arise. Understanding user behavior, identifying trends, and detecting anomalies requires detailed intelligence that many solutions fail to deliver. Furthermore, with expanding regulatory requirements, companies must be mindful of where and how their data is stored and processed, often necessitating jurisdiction-specific compliance.
