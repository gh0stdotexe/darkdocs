## What is DNS-over-TLS?

<Info>
DNS-over-TLS (DoT) is a security protocol that provides privacy for DNS queries by establishing a TLS encrypted connection between the client and the DNS server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering of DNS traffic.
</Info>

## Key Benefits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Encrypted Communication">
    All DNS queries and responses are encrypted using TLS, ensuring privacy and security.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Native Support">
    DoT is supported natively by many modern operating systems and devices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authentication">
    TLS certificates provide authentication of the DNS server, preventing spoofing attacks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using DoT with Control D

<Accordion title="Configuration Steps">
  ### Android
  1. Open Settings
  2. Navigate to Network & Internet > Private DNS
  3. Select "Private DNS provider hostname"
  4. Enter your Control D DoT hostname

  ### iOS
  1. Install a DoT-compatible DNS client
  2. Configure the client with Control D's DoT endpoint
  3. Enable DNS encryption

  ### Linux
  1. Configure systemd-resolved or your preferred DNS client
  2. Add Control D's DoT endpoint
  3. Enable DoT encryption
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Ensure your network allows traffic on port 853, which is the standard port for DNS-over-TLS. Some networks may block this port by default.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Card title="Recommended Settings">
  - Use DoT in environments where DoH might not be suitable
  - Configure proper certificate validation
  - Set up fallback DNS servers for reliability
  - Monitor your Control D dashboard for connection status
  - Regularly update your DNS client software
