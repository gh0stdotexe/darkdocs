# How to Troubleshoot Geo-Blocking Issues

<Warning>
Control D is a security and productivity platform, **not a geo-unblocking service**. We don't mention this feature anywhere on our website and offer it on a best effort basis only. You should not sign up to Control D if this is your primary use case.
</Warning>

## 1. What Not to Do

<Info>
We will not take action on reports that sound like:
- "Service X doesn't work"
- "Service Y on my phone is lagging and giving me errors"
- "Can you make service Z work thanks"
</Info>

## 2. What to Do

<Note>
To get help with geo-blocking issues, you need to:
- Troubleshoot the issue yourself
- Collect relevant logs
- Document what you tried
- Explain what you think the problem is
</Note>

## 3. Step 1 - Verify

<Steps>
  <Step>Check the Activity Log</Step>
  <Step>Verify the service is being redirected</Step>
  <Step>Confirm the location is supported</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Step 2 - Try Another Device

<Info>
To rule out device-specific issues:
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step>Use a desktop browser</Step>
  <Step>Use the same Control D profile</Step>
  <Step>Attempt to access the service</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Step 3 - Attempt Fix

<Warning>
The most common issue is new domains that need redirection.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step>Check for new domain names</Step>
  <Step>Verify redirection settings</Step>
  <Step>Test with different locations</Step>
  <Step>Document successful configurations</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
If these steps resolve the issue, send us:
- The domains you redirected
- The full Activity log
</Info>

## 6. Step 4 - Send Us Data

<Warning>
Don't skip to this step. Perform steps 1-3 first.
</Warning>

<Info>
If everything fails, provide:
- Exact service you're using
- Affected device details
- Steps you've taken
- List of important domains
- Full activity log
</Info>
