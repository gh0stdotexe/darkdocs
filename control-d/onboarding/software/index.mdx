In order to setup Control D, in most cases no software is required. That being said, Control D offers several applications that can make setup by non-tech savvy end users a breeze. Additionally, we offer a command line daemon that can be used by network administrators to setup Control D on routers, end user devices using group policy / RMM, and more.
