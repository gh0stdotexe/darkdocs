Overview

Multi-Tenancy in the context of Organizations is a feature offered by Control D that enables businesses to effectively manage their DNS infrastructure across various units within the organization. It streamlines DNS management and offers the flexibility to cater to diverse operational requirements within a single umbrella organization.

# 

Problem Solved

Multi-Tenancy addresses the complexity of managing internet access and policies across different departments, subsidiaries, or customer accounts within a large enterprise or service provider setting. This feature allows businesses to:

  * Manage end-user devices or network settings across the entire organization
  * [Rapidly deploy](/docs/provisioning) DNS settings to a large number of devices, utilizing tools like Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)
  * Provide team members with tailor-made access to view or modify DNS configurations
  * Organize Profiles (policies) and Devices into Sub-Organizations for better control and delegation

# 

Feature Benefits

  * **Centralized Management** : One-stop shop to manage the overall DNS policy and Profiles for various branches or units.
  * **Customizable Access** : Grant selected permissions to team members to manage different aspects of the organization's assets.
  * **Segmented Control** : Create Sub-Organizations representing different departments or customer groups, each with its custom settings.
  * **Compliance and Security** : Option to lock down resolvers to pre-defined IP addresses, enhancing security and ensuring compliance with company policies.
  * **Operational Efficiency** : Share Profiles between Sub-Organizations to maintain consistency and streamline the application of changes. Enforce [Global Profiles](/docs/multiple-enforced-profiles) and avoid duplication. 
  * **Enhanced Administration** : Update essential details, manage 2FA/MFA settings, and control data storage preferences from the My Organization tab.
