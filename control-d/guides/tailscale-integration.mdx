# Tailscale Integration

<Info>
You can use Control D as a <Link href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1403/control-d">Global Nameserver</Link> in Tailscale, and take control of your DNS for your entire tailnet.
</Info>

## Create an Endpoint

<Info>
Head over to the Control D web panel, and create an Endpoint. The type does not matter, but we recommend using "Other" type device from the Routers section.
