## What is a DNS Stamp?

A DNS stamp is a compact, encoded string that contains all the necessary information to configure a DNS client. It includes details such as the server address, protocol type, public key (if applicable), and other properties in a single, shareable format.

## DNS Stamp Format

DNS stamps follow this general structure:
```
sdns://<base64url-encoded-parameters>
```

The encoded parameters include:
- Protocol (DoH, DoT, DNSCrypt)
- Server address and port
- Public key (for DNSCrypt)
- Provider name
- Path (for DoH)

## Creating DNS Stamps

### For DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS)

```bash
# Format
sdns://AgcAAAAAAAAACzc2Ljc2LjIuMjQ0AA9kb2guY29udHJvbGQuY29tCi9kbnMtcXVlcnk

# Components:
# Ag = DoH
# Properties flags
# Server IP (76.76.2.244)
# Hostname (doh.controld.com)
# Path (/dns-query)
```

### For DoT (DNS-over-TLS)

```bash
# Format
sdns://AwcAAAAAAAAACzc2Ljc2LjIuMjQ0ABNkb3QuY29udHJvbGQuY29tOjg1Mw

# Components:
# Aw = DoT
# Properties flags
# Server IP (76.76.2.244)
# Hostname and port (dot.controld.com:853)
```

## Using DNS Stamps

1. Copy the appropriate DNS stamp for your desired protocol
2. Configure your DNS client using the stamp
3. Verify the connection is working properly

<Warning>
Always verify DNS stamps before using them. Incorrect stamps can lead to connection issues or security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

## Implementation Examples

### Command Line Verification

```bash
# Decode a DNS stamp
echo "sdns://AgcAAAAAAAAACzc2Ljc2LjIuMjQ0AA9kb2guY29udHJvbGQuY29tCi9kbnMtcXVlcnk" | base64 -d
```

### Client Configuration

```yaml
dns:
  stamp: "sdns://AgcAAAAAAAAACzc2Ljc2LjIuMjQ0AA9kb2guY29udHJvbGQuY29tCi9kbnMtcXVlcnk"
  protocol: "doh"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Always use HTTPS/TLS for secure transmission
2. **Validation**: Verify stamps before deployment
3. **Backup**: Keep a copy of your DNS stamps in a secure location
4. **Documentation**: Document which stamps are used in your configuration

<Tip>
You can use online DNS stamp generators to create stamps for your specific needs, but always verify the output before using in production.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with DNS stamps:

1. Verify the stamp is correctly encoded
2. Check if the protocol matches your client's capabilities
3. Ensure the server address is accessible
4. Confirm the hostname matches your SSL certificate (for DoH/DoT)
