Legacy DNS

Follow the steps below to configure Control D on your NETGEAR router. 

Keep in mind that NETGEAR routers use legacy DNS at the moment.

## 

Step 1

Open the NETGEAR router interface by navigating to it in your browser. You can reach it via `routerlogin.net` or `192.168.1.1`.

Step 4

Now determine which DNS resolver you want to use. 

### 

Free Resolver

If you are configuring our free DNS resolvers, you can get the IPs from this page: <https://controld.com/free-dns>

  1. Select the configuration you want to use from the list:

  2. Then copy the Legacy Resolver IP address that appears at the bottom of the page:

### 

Custom Resolver

If you are configuring a custom Legacy DNS resolver: 

  1. Create a new "Other" Router Device on your [Control D Dashboard](https://controld.com/dashboard/devices). Link it to a Profile (or [create a new Profile if you don't have one](/docs/profiles)) and finally make sure to enable the **Legacy Resolver** option under **Advanced Settings**. Then press **Add Device** :

  2. Expand the **Legacy DNS** section where you will see the IP addresses to use for the setup. Do NOT copy the same IPs from the screenshot, copy the ones from your account specifically.

## 

Step 5

Once you have selected the DNS IP you want to use, you can enter it in the **Primary** and **Secondary DNS** fields.

Finally, press **Apply** near the bottom of the page.

Once the router saves the configuration, you are using Control D on your network! 

Keep in mind that if you configure a custom DNS on any of the individual devices connected to this router, those devices will not be using the DNS you configured here.

> This method is subject to your [source IP being registered](/docs/ip-management) on this Device in the web control panel, so this is best suited for networks with a static IP. If you have a Dynamic IP see [Legacy DNS limitations](/docs/ip-not-authorized) section for solution.
