# Check if DNS is Working

<Note>
This guide will help you verify if Control D is working properly and provide steps to fix it if it's not.
</Note>

## 1. Quick Check

<Steps>
  <Step>Visit the [Status Page](https://controld.com/status)</Step>
  <Step>Check if it shows you're using Control D</Step>
  <Step>If working, you're all set!</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Command Line Check

<Info>
If you've configured Control D on your network router or directly on the network interface, it should be set up OS-wide.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step>Open Terminal or Command Prompt</Step>
  <Step>
    Run the following command:
    <CodeBlock>
      nslookup verify.controld.com
    </CodeBlock>
  </Step>
  <Step>Check the output for Control D IP addresses</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If the command returns an IP address:
- Your OS is using Control D
- The issue might be with your browser using DNS-over-HTTPS
- Configure DNS-over-HTTPS in your browser using the tutorials
</Warning>

<Warning>
If the command does NOT return a valid IP:
- Your OS is not using Control D
- Double-check your settings
- Verify your configuration
</Warning>

## 3. External Check

<Info>
For devices without a browser or command line:
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step>Start the Activity Log on your device</Step>
  <Step>Perform some actions on the device</Step>
  <Step>Check if records appear in the Activity Log</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If the log is always blank:
