# Custom-Branded Block Page Setup on macOS

This guide will walk you through setting up a custom-branded block page using Control D on an Apple MacBook Pro. A custom block page allows you to display your own branded message when users attempt to access blocked content.

<Tip>
Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- Administrative access to your Control D dashboard
- A valid Control D subscription
- macOS administrator privileges
</Tip>

## Step 1: Configure the Control D Profile

### Access Control D Profile Options

1. Log in to the Control D Dashboard
2. Navigate to the **Profiles** section
3. Select the profile you want to modify

### Set Custom Block Response

1. Click on **Profile Options**
2. Locate the **Block Response** setting
3. Select **Custom** from the dropdown menu
4. Configure the following IP addresses for your custom block page:

```bash
IPv4: 23.171.240.158
IPv6: 2606:1a40:3000:4800::158
```

<Tip>
These IP addresses are specifically configured for Control D's custom block page service. Do not modify them unless instructed by Control D support.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Install the Root Certificate

### Download the Certificate

1. Download the Control D root certificate from the official source:
   [Control D Root Certificate](https://deploy.controld.com/blockpage/Control-D-root-x1.cer)

### Install the Certificate

1. Open the downloaded `.cer` file with **Keychain Access**
2. Select the **System** keychain from the sidebar
3. Drag the certificate into the **System** keychain
4. Double-click the certificate to open its details
5. Expand the **Trust** section
6. Set the certificate trust to **Always Trust**

<Warning>
Installing a root certificate requires administrative privileges. Make sure you're logged in as an administrator on your Mac.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Apply Changes on macOS

### Flush DNS Cache

To ensure your MacBook Pro correctly displays the custom block page, you'll need to flush the DNS cache. Open Terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

<Tip>
You may need to enter your administrator password when executing these commands.
</Tip>

## Verification

To verify that your custom block page is working correctly:

1. Try accessing a blocked website
2. You should see your custom block page instead of the default browser error
3. The page should load securely (with HTTPS)

<Warning>
If you don't see the custom block page after following these steps:
- Verify that the root certificate is properly installed
- Check that the IP addresses are correctly configured
- Try clearing your browser cache
- Restart your browser
