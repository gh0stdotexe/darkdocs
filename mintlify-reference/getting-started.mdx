# Getting Started with Mintlify

This guide will help you get started with Mintlify, from installation to your first deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 16 or later installed
- A GitHub account
- A Mintlify account (you can sign up at [mintlify.com](https://mintlify.com))

## Installation

1. Install the Mintlify CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g mintlify
```

2. Create a new documentation project:

```bash
mintlify init
```

3. Follow the prompts to set up your project:
   - Choose a project name
   - Select a template
   - Configure your GitHub repository

## Project Structure

A typical Mintlify project structure looks like this:

```
docs/
├── docs.json          # Navigation configuration
├── index.mdx          # Homepage
├── getting-started.mdx
├── components/        # Custom components
├── public/           # Static assets
└── styles/           # Custom styles
```

## Writing Content

Mintlify uses MDX, which combines Markdown with React components. Here's a basic example:

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
description: "A sample page"
---

# My Page

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

<Tip>
This is a tip component!
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
<CodeGroupItem title="JavaScript">

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Mintlify!");
```

</CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>
```

## Deployment

To deploy your documentation:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Mintlify will automatically build and deploy your site
3. Your documentation will be available at `https://your-project.mintlify.app`
