## What is DNS-over-HTTPS?

<Info>
DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol. This protocol is designed to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks.
</Info>

## Key Benefits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enhanced Security">
    All DNS queries are encrypted using HTTPS, making it difficult for attackers to intercept or modify DNS requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modern OS Support">
    DoH is widely supported by modern operating systems including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Firewall Friendly">
    Since DoH uses standard HTTPS (port 443), it works well with existing firewalls and network configurations.
  </Step>

  3. Restart the DNS service
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Make sure to use the correct DoH endpoint URL provided in your Control D dashboard. Using incorrect endpoints may result in resolution failures.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Card title="Recommended Settings">
  - Enable DNS-over-HTTPS whenever possible for maximum security
