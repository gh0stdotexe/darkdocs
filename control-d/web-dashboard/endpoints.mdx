## Overview

Endpoints in Control D represent devices or networks that use your DNS filtering service. Each endpoint can have its own configuration, profiles, and monitoring settings.

## Features

### Multiple Enforced Profiles
- Apply multiple filtering profiles to a single endpoint
- Set profile priorities
- Configure profile schedules
- Override specific rules

### IP Management
```yaml
ip_settings:
  auto_authorize: true
  whitelist:
    - "192.168.1.0/24"
    - "10.0.0.0/8"
  dynamic_ip: true
```

### Legacy Resolver
- Support for older DNS protocols
- Backward compatibility
- Custom port configuration
- Protocol-specific settings

### Auto Authorize IP
1. Enable automatic IP authorization
2. Set trusted networks
3. Configure authorization rules
4. Monitor access logs

### Dynamic DNS
```yaml
ddns:
  enabled: true
  hostname: "device.example.com"
  update_interval: 300
  provider: "controld"
```

### Expose IP via DNS
- Query endpoint IP through DNS
- Custom DNS record configuration
- IP update propagation
- Access control settings

### Analytics
- Query statistics
- Traffic patterns
- Blocked requests
- Performance metrics

### Status
- Real-time endpoint status
- Connection health
- Profile activation
- Update status

### Prevent Deactivation
```yaml
security:
  prevent_deactivation: true
  require_auth: true
  notify_admin: true
```

### Device Clients
- Monitor connected clients
- Client-specific rules
- Usage statistics
- Access control

## Organization Features

### Restricted Resolver
- Limit endpoint access
- IP-based restrictions
- Profile enforcement
- Audit logging

### Add Multiple Devices
```yaml
bulk_add:
  prefix: "office-"
  count: 10
  profile: "default"
  auto_authorize: true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Enable auto-authorization only for trusted networks
   - Regularly review connected devices
   - Monitor unauthorized access attempts
   - Keep endpoint configurations updated

2. **Management**
   - Use descriptive device names
   - Group similar devices
   - Document custom configurations
   - Regular backup of device settings

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for device status
   - Review analytics regularly
   - Track profile changes
   - Monitor client activity

<Warning>
Always verify endpoint configurations before deployment to prevent accidental exposure or misconfiguration.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use device tags and groups to manage multiple endpoints efficiently and apply bulk configurations.
