<Steps>
  <Step title="Modern Protocols">
    Most don't support modern (encrypted) DNS protocols - security services over UDP53 is crazy!

  <Step title="Mobile Support">
    Don't work on mobile devices without apps (or Wireguard tunnels)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintenance">
    Require constant effort to keep running
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Experience">
