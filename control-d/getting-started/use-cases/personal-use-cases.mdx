# Personal Use Cases

The following list of use cases is not exhaustive, but should help you understand what Control D can do for you.

## Secure Home Wi-Fi

Control D can help you secure your home network by blocking malicious domains, phishing attempts, and other threats. It's like having an enterprise-grade security solution for your home.

## Improve Privacy (and browse faster)

Block trackers, analytics, and other privacy-invading services. As a side effect, your browsing experience will be faster since you're not loading unnecessary tracking scripts.

## Improve Productivity

Block distracting websites and services during work hours. You can create different profiles for work and leisure time, and switch between them with a single click.

## Parental Controls

Create different profiles for different family members, and enforce age-appropriate content filtering. Block adult content, gambling sites, and other inappropriate material.
