# Custom-Branded Block Page Setup on macOS

This guide will walk you through setting up a custom-branded block page using Control D on an Apple MacBook Pro.

## Step 1: Configure the Control D Profile

1. **Access Control D Profile Options**:
   - Log in to the Control D Dashboard and navigate to Profiles.
   - Select the profile you want to modify.

2. **Set Custom Block Response**:
   - Click on "Profile Options."
   - Find the "Block Response" setting.
   - Select "Custom" from the dropdown.
   - Input the following IPs for your custom block page:
     - **IPv4**: `23.171.240.158`
     - **IPv6**: `2606:1a40:3000:4800::158`

## Step 2: Install the Root Certificate

1. **Download the Certificate**:
   - Download the Control D root certificate from [here](https://deploy.controld.com/blockpage/Control-D-root-x1.cer).

2. **Install the Certificate**:
   - Open the downloaded `.cer` file with Keychain Access.
   - Select the "System" keychain.
   - Drag the certificate into the "System" keychain.
   - Double-click the certificate, expand "Trust," and set to "Always Trust."

## Step 3: Apply Changes on macOS

1. **Flush DNS Cache**:
   - Open Terminal and execute:  
     ```bash
     sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
     ```

This ensures that your MacBook Pro correctly displays the custom block page.
